#+TITLE: The Ultimate Doom Emacs Cheatsheet
#+SETUPFILE: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/org/theme-readtheorg.setup

* A few tips for Emacs newbies
- Learn to use [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient][emacsclient]] and set up a daemon, your Emacs experience will improve *a lot* and you'll save a lot of time.
- Learn to use Emacs's inner file manager.
- Try to avoid terminal version of emacs when possible.
- =SPC h w= helps you find keyboard shortcuts for different commands, and =SPC h k= tells you how key combinations translate to emacs commands. 
- Github doesn't render org files very well. It's best that you [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niyumard/Doom-Emacs-Cheat-Sheet/main/README.org][download this file]] and open it in Emacs. If not possible, use the [[https://naghdbishi.ir/Doom-Emacs-Cheat-Sheet/README.html][html version]] made with [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][org-html-themes]]

- You can create your own snippets in the following directory: =~/.doom.d/snippets/=
** Task Management
- Create a task by prefixing any heading with =TODO=
- =DONE= means the task is done
- You can create your custom key words by changing this variable: =org-todo-keywords=
  - remember you can get to your variables through =SPC h v= (M-x counsel-describe-variable)
  - These values are already set in Doom:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
           ((sequence "TODO(t)" "PROJ(p)" "STRT(s)" "WAIT(w)" "HOLD(h)" "|" "DONE(d)" "KILL(k)")
        (sequence "[ ](T)" "[-](S)" "[?](W)" "|" "[X](D)"))
    #+END_EXAMPLE
- =SPC m t= to change a status of a todo

  tag

*** Setting a poperty for a task/headline
- =SPC m o= is used for setting a property.
**** Marking Headlines with Categories

  - If you want to set a category (for chani 
** Lists
- Two types of lists, ordered and unordered lists
  - =SHIFT right= and =SHIFT left= can be used to change the type of lists.
- You can also change an unorded list by changing the first item to 1. and then typing =C-c C-c= and vice verca.
** Checkboxes
- [ ] This is still todo
- [-] This is in progress
- [X] This is a done task
*** You can see how many are done with a "cookie" [1/2]
- [-] Task 1
- [X] Task 2
- You can do this by adding [/] to the heading and pressing =C-c C-c=
- You can't assign a tag or a priority

- Press =s= under "Unstaged changes" to stage a change
  + =u= to undo a change
  + =c= to commit
- =b s= for branch and spinoff to create another branch, rewinding the
  commits you made to master
- =b b= to switch branches

  selecting
- =V= to select a change in a diff and =x= to discard that change.
- =s= to stage
- =c= to commit, you can =q= to quit the commit screen
- =P= to push and then =p= to your remote or =u= to a another remote

These keybinding only work after installing org-roam. To install org roam edit your =init.el= file and add =(org +roam2)= in its designated place. Watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyhPmypHDEw][this video]] to understand what org-roam is.
