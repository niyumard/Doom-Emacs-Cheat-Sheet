#+TITLE: The Ultimate Doom Emacs Cheatsheet

* A few tips for Emacs newbies
- Use [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient][EmacsClient]] and set up a daemon. Your Emacs experience will improve *a lot* and you will save a lot of time.
- For better experience, use Emacs's built-in file manager.
- Get [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][LSP]] up and running. It will turn Emacs into a fully-featured modern IDE. Emacs supports LSP for almost every language.
- Try to avoid the terminal version of Emacs when possible.
- Use Doom Emacs's built-in helps to understand how things work under the hood and change them to suit your needs.
  - =SPC h k= tells you how key combinations translate to Emacs commands.
  - =SPC h w= helps you find keyboard shortcuts for different commands.
  - =SPC h v= lets you see what's inside variables and change them.
  - =SPC h f= tells you about functions and where they are defined.
  - =SPC h b b= to see a list of all keybindings
- Github doesn't render org files very well. It's best that you clone this repository and open it in Emacs.
- See other files in this repository as well. Currently additional instructions for Go, and Python are also offered. If there's anything missing, or you can suggest a better workflow, make sure to contribute.
- Doom Emacs is a great emacs distro, but for a deeper understanding of Emacs, try setting up a minimal version of Emacs yourself using [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-11-28-basic-emacs-configuration/][this guide]] or [[https://arne.me/blog/emacs-from-scratch-part-two][similar]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74zOY-vgkyw&list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ][ones]].

* Buffers, Windows and Basic Navigation
** Buffers
- Buffers are a special concept in emacs they can be terminals, files,
  directories, etc
- =SPC b b= to open another buffer
  - workspace buffer
- =SPC b B= you can see all the buffer
- =SPC ,= to switch buffers (it's an alias)

- =SPC w == to balance window sizes
- =SPC w += and =SPC w -= to increase and decrease window height
- =SPC w >= and =SPC w <= to increase and decrease window width
- You can use vim motion keys to navigate between open windows for example =SPC w H= moves the window to the left.
** Workspaces
- =SPC TAB n= New workspace

- To add a package, add the package to =.doom.d/package.el=
- Then close and =doom refresh=
- Then go to =.doom.d/config.el= to configure the package
- =def-package!= is a macro you can use to configure packages
  - =space h help= you can look up method man pages
  - =:init= is used for setting the package up
  - =:config= to set configuration after the package has been
    initialized
  - =:after= lets you set which package it should load after
- You can use =:after!= to configure packages that are already there
* Quick, horizontal movements with evil-snipe
** Inline navigation
- =f= and then the letter you want to navigate to.
  + =,= will go backward
  + =;= will go forward after that "find"
- =t= to find and move cursor to the character before what you've searched.
- =v= puts you in visual mode. You can select text by with =v t some-char-you-navigate-to= or =v f some-char-you-navigate-to=
- =;= to jump to the next find
- =,= to jump to the previous one
- =s= to snipe
** Long distance navigation inside the file
- Evil-snipe lets you go to all the occurrences in your document
- =g s SPC= to use avy and going to a certain word in file.
- =t= is the same thing except for a character you want to jump to before the one you insert
- =s= to do a double character search
- Evil-snipe will remember your last search so =,= and =;= will navigate
- =F= or =T= to go backwards
- =g s SPC= and then select the letter that avy gives you to navigate to that spot
  - These letters are on your home row so they are easy to click
- =SPC h v= for variable, to set the avy variable to search all open
  windows
  + =avy-all-windows= lets you search in all windows open.
- You can remove a word with
  =g s SPC select-one-letter x select-the-removal-spot=
  + You can use =X= to stay in your original spot of search
- You can go =g s space select-one-letter i select-the-correction-spot=
  to correct the spelling of the search
  - Install ispell on your OS first
- You can =yank= a word from one place to another with
  =g s SPC select-one-letter y select-the-correction-spot-to-paste=
- Use =t= to "teleport" the word from one place to another
  =g s SPC select-one-letter t select-the-correction-spot-to-teleport=
* Multiple cursor in Emacs with evil-multiedit
- Using evil-multiedit (known as multiple cursors in other IDEs) you can make selections and then edit those selections simultaneously. To do this uncomment =multiple-cursors= in your =init.el=.
- =M-d= will select the current word, press this again and it will find another occurrence
- =M-D= will find an occurrence upward
- You can use a visual selection to select multiple words as well.
- =R= will select all occurrences.
- =CTRL n= for next selection =CTRL p= for previous.
- Exclude matches with =RET=
- You can make an edit and the changes will be reflected to all the selections.
* Org Mode
** Basics
- Org mode gives you the ability to structure your document
- =*= for a h1 =**= for an h2 and so on
- You can =TAB= a section to fold a subtree (hide it)
- You can use =SHIFT TAB= to cycle through folded states
- =CTRL return= to create a headline of the same type
- =M-arrow up= lets you shift the position of the section
- =M-h= promotes a headline to the next level
- =M-l= demotes
- You can create lists
  1. one
  2. 2
  3. wooo
  4. 3

** Links, Hyperlinks and more
- =SPC m l= to add a link to an org page
- You can add =::= to specify a heading or a line number
- You can paste http links as well
- You can "link" some text with specific code =SPC m l= elisp: [[elisp:(+ 2 2)][(+ 2 2)]] when you click the link, emacs will evaluate the expression
- Show [[elisp:org-agenda][My Agenda]]
- [[shell:ls][List Files]] in directory
** Defining custom Link Types
- [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=Febe4lUK5G4][Watch the video about custom links]]
** Linking to words & Bookmarks
- =SPC n l= stores a link to a particular headline
** Code Snippets & Babel
- =SPC i s= for inserting code snippets
  + Example:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (+ 2 3 4 5)
   #+end_src
- =C-c C-c= to execute the code.
- =SPC m '= to edit inside the babel in another buffer.
- Results will show up in a =##+RESULTS= header
- This feature is called Babel
- One snippet can consume the output of another snippet
- You can create your own snippets in the following directory: =~/.doom.d/snippets/=
** Task Management
- Create a task by prefixing any heading with =TODO=
- =DONE= means the task is done
- You can create your custom key words by changing this variable: =org-todo-keywords=
  - remember you can get to your variables through =SPC h v= (M-x counsel-describe-variable)
  - These values are already set in Doom:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
           ((sequence "TODO(t)" "PROJ(p)" "STRT(s)" "WAIT(w)" "HOLD(h)" "|" "DONE(d)" "KILL(k)")
        (sequence "[ ](T)" "[-](S)" "[?](W)" "|" "[X](D)"))
    #+END_EXAMPLE
- =SPC m t= to change a status of a todo
- =SHIFT left= and =SHIFT right= can be used to change the status of a todo as well.
- If you finish a task with a command, org mode will add a date that you "closed" the task.
- =SPC o a t= to open the agenda -> todo list
- =q= to quit
- =org-agenda-files= is a variable you can set to filter which files agenda searches for todos in.

*** Priorities for Tasks
- =SHIFT up= and =SHIFT down= will toggle the priority of tasks
- =org-fancy-priorities= gives you fancy looking priorities

*** Marking Tasks with Tags
- Tags can be attached to any headlines
- =SPC m q= to tag a headline
- Example:
  - TODO play more games :fun:
- Tags are hierarchical so nested headings will be tagged with the
  parent header tag
- =org-tag-sparce-tree= will search for headings that only have a specific
  tag

*** Setting a property for a task/headline
- =SPC m o= is used for setting a property.
**** Marking Headlines with Categories
- You can use [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Categories.html][categories]] to change the label in agenda view.
**** Org-Habits
- If you want to [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html][keep track of your habits]] using org mode, you can set the =STYLE= property to habit.
** Lists
- Two types of lists, ordered and unordered lists
  - =SHIFT right= and =SHIFT left= can be used to change the type of lists.
- You can also change an unordered list by changing the first item to 1. and then typing =C-c C-c= and vice versa.
** Checkboxes
- [ ] This is still todo
- [-] This is in progress
- [X] This is a done task
*** You can see how many are done with a "cookie" [1/2]
- [-] Task 1
- [X] Task 2
- You can do this by adding [/] to the heading and pressing =C-c C-c=
- You can't assign a tag or a priority
** Misc
- =C-c C-z= to insert a note for a heading in org mode.
:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2020-12-18 Fri 21:52] \\
  Like this!
:END:
- =C-c C-c= to insert a tag for a heading in org mode.
* Magit
- Magit is enabled by default in Doom Emacs's init.el
- =SPC g g= shows Magit status page
  + Most commands are done from the status page
  + Use tab to expand headlines in the status page
- =?= in Magit's status page for a nice list of available commands and help, =q= to close this help page
- Open diff view for a file with =TAB=
- Press =s= under "Unstaged changes" to stage a change
  + =u= to undo a change
  + =c= to commit
- =b s= for branch and spinoff to create another branch, rewinding the
  commits you made to master
- =b b= to switch branches

** Git Commit Flow in More Detail
- =t t= to create a tag, default place is the commit you are currently
  selecting
- =V= to select a change in a diff and =x= to discard that change.
- =s= to stage
- =c= to commit, you can =q= to quit the commit screen
- =P= to push and then =p= to your remote or =u= to a another remote
** Magit with Forge for Issuing Pull Requests - Emacs
- Forge is installed in emacs doom
- =@= for forge
- Set up forge with =M-x forge-pull=
  - the first time you will get a token from Github
- =@ c p= to create a pull request with forge
  - select the base branch
  - then select the target branch
  - then provide a short description
  - =CTRL c CTRL c= to finish the pull request
- Now there will be a =pull requests= tab
* LSP-Mode
** LSP related
- =lsp-update-server= select a language server to update.
- =lsp-workspace-folders-add= to interactively set a folder as an LSP workspace.
- =lsp-workspace-folders-remove= to interactively unset a folder as an LSP workspace.
- =lsp-workspace-restart= to restart your workspace. Especially useful after activating a virtual environment.
** While coding
- =SPC c c= to run a compile command (or a test, or any other command in the current directory)
- =SPC c C= to repeat the command above
- =SPC c d= jump to var/func/... definitions
  - =C o= (=evil-jump-backward=) Go back to your last position in the jump list
  - =C i= (=evil-jump-forward=) Go forward in the jump list
- =SPC c D= see references to var/func/...
- =SPC c e= to evaluate the current buffer or region (when nothing is selected, equivalent to running =SPC c c= and writing =go run= + the file name.)

- =SPC o t= for opening vterm in a popup window
* File Tree
- Set up neotree or treemacs in your init.el file.
- =SPC o p= for opening neotree or treemacs
* Capturing
- =SPC X= to capture (the new thing gets captured to a single file but that's fine since we can easily refile it.)
- =SPC m r r= to refile
* Org Roam
These keybindings only work after installing org-roam. To install org-roam edit your =init.el= file and add =(org +roam2)= in its designated place. Watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyhPmypHDEw][this video]] to understand what org-roam is.

Code folding helps with code readability. First, make sure =fold= is not commented in your =init.el= file then move your cursor to the definition of a class or a function and try the following:

- =z a= Toggle the fold at point.
- =z m= Close all the folds.
- =z r= Open all the folds.
- =z j= Next folded region.
- =z k= Previous folded region.

* Latex & pdf-view-mode
** pdf-view-mode
- If you want to be able to open PDF files in your Doom Emacs you should uncomment =pdf= under =:tools= in your =init.el= file.
- After opening a PDF, if pdf-view-mode isn't automatically enabled, enable it by running =SPC := and then =pdf-view-mode=. For the first time you may need to compile the tools needed by Emacs to view PDFs.
- Make sure to use the keyboard shortcuts (especially the first four) instead of using your mouse.
*** Zoom and scroll
- =W= to fit PDF size to your window's width.
- =C-d= to scroll up or move to the next page.
- =C-u= to scroll down or move to the previous page.

- arrow keys to move from one page to another.
- =M-g g= to jump to a certain page.
- =o= to display an outline of the PDF.
- =​== to enlargen the PDF.
- =-= to shrink the PDF.
- =H= to fit PDF size to your window's height.
- =Q= to quit the PDF.


** Latex
- Clicking on a PDF made by Latex in pdf-view-mode will open the tex file that has made that page. Make sure to view your PDFs from inside Emacs.
- TBD, for now see [[https://michaelneuper.com/posts/efficient-latex-editing-with-emacs/][Michael Neuper's blog post]] which has videos as well.

* Bi-directinal texts (RTL languages)
- First uncomment =bidi= under =:input= in =init.el=
- If your cursor moves at the wrong direction, see this [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/892][evil-mode bug]] and toggle evil-mode by pressing =C-z= if neccessary.
- To enable the bidi-mode everywhere and change the font of Persian/Arabic texts, you can use the snippet below:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(+bidi-global-mode 1)
(setq +bidi-want-smart-fontify nil)
(set-fontset-font t 'arabic "Sahel") ; Works for Persian as well
#+end_src
